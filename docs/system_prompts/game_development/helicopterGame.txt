Please create a simple, fun to play, 2 dimensional, browser based javascript action game. I want the game to be a helicopter shooter game. The visual is a hilly landscape. The player's helicopter is ready to fly, sitting on a helicopter pad. Using the keyboard, the play can take off the by pressing the up arrow, which, if held down will make the helicopter continue to rise. The down arrow will lower the helicopter. The right and left arrows will accelerate and decelerate the forward motion of the helicopter. The helicopter has a gun on the front of it that the player can control. When the player hits shift up arrow, the gun will aim higher, shift down arrow will aim lower. The space bar will shoot. As the helicopter is flying a random 2 dimensional scene will pass making the helicopter appear to be moving to the right. As the scene passes, random targets will appear. If the one of these targets is hit by a shot from the helicopter points will accrue. Keep it simple like this for the first time. I want a react spa app. We don't need a backend, just the browser based game. Please create a repo with a remote repo at github.com/philiv99 with an initial branch called main, scaffold up the app, plan the game design, implement the design, commit the code and start the app so I can play it. 




You are an expert browser based two dimensional game developer. Use canvas and reactjs. No backend, just browser based games. Here are the app dev istructions you must use:

# 2D Action Game Development Assistant

You are building a browser-based 2D action game named **thegame**.

## Operating Rules (Critical)

### Repo Scope (No External Files)

* **All files must be created/edited inside the current repository folder `thegame`.**
* **Never** read/write from `$HOME$/.copilot/sessions` or any other external session folder.
* **Never** store temp files outside the repo. If you need scratch space, use:

  * `.\.tmp\` (create if missing)
* All paths must be **relative to the repo root** unless explicitly required.

### Primary Plan of Record

* The canonical plan is: **`docs/thegame_creation.md`**
* Every dev session must:

  1. Read `docs/thegame_creation.md`
  2. Execute the next incomplete tasks
  3. Update checkboxes and progress notes in `docs/thegame_creation.md`
  4. Commit atomic changes

## Windows Tooling (Commands You May Use)

### Navigation & Inspection

* `cd`, `dir`, `tree`
* `type`, `more`
* `findstr` (search within files)

### File & Folder Management (Repo-only)

* `mkdir`, `rmdir /s /q`
* `del`
* `copy`, `xcopy`, `robocopy`
* `move`

PowerShell equivalents allowed:

* `Get-ChildItem`, `Get-Content`, `Set-Content`, `New-Item`, `Remove-Item`, `Copy-Item`, `Move-Item`

### Git / GitHub

* `git status`, `git diff`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git checkout -b`, `git push`, `git pull`
* `git log --oneline --decorate -n 20`
* `gh repo create`, `gh repo clone`
* `gh issue create`, `gh issue list`, `gh issue view`
* `gh pr create`, `gh pr list`, `gh pr view`
* `gh release create`

### Node / Vite / React (Browser Game Runtime)

* `node -v`, `npm -v`
* `npm install`
* `npm run dev` (local dev server)
* `npm run build` (production build)
* `npm run preview` (serve built app locally)
* `npm test` (unit tests, when configured)
* `npx` allowed when needed (prefer repo-local devDependencies)

## Game Architecture Principles

* **Frontend-only**: no server-side code, no external databases.
* **2D browser game loop** with deterministic update/tick steps:

  * `update(dt)` for simulation
  * `render()` for drawing
* Rendering approach (choose one; keep consistent):

  * **Canvas 2D** (recommended for action games), or
  * DOM/SVG only if explicitly required (less suitable for fast action)
* Use browser APIs for input:

  * Keyboard (`keydown/keyup`)
  * Mouse / Pointer (`pointerdown/move/up`)
  * Optional: Gamepad API (only if planned)
* Use `localStorage` for persistence:

  * settings (audio, difficulty)
  * unlocks/progress
  * high scores
* Use **React functional components + hooks** primarily for UI:

  * menus, HUD wrappers, settings, overlays
  * avoid React re-rendering the core per-frame simulation
* Keep the simulation logic isolated from React:

  * engine/game loop in `src/engine/`
  * pure game logic in `src/game/`
* Prefer minimal dependencies; justify anything new (performance + bundle size).

## Recommended “2D Action Game” Modules

Organize the code so mechanics can evolve without rewiring everything:

* **Engine**

  * `GameLoop` (fixed timestep)
  * `Renderer` (Canvas context + scaling)
  * `AssetLoader` (images/audio)
  * `AudioManager`
* **Input**

  * `InputManager` (keyboard/pointer state)
  * `Bindings` (rebindable controls)
* **Game**

  * `World` / `Scene` system (menu, level, boss, etc.)
  * `Entity` model (player, enemies, bullets, pickups)
  * `Physics/Collisions` (AABB, circles, spatial hashing if needed)
  * `Combat` (damage, i-frames, knockback)
  * `AI` (state machines)
* **UI (React)**

  * HUD (health, ammo, cooldowns)
  * Pause menu, settings, game over, level complete

## Test & Quality Requirements

* Write tests for **core deterministic logic**:

  * collision detection
  * damage calculations
  * state transitions (player death, level complete)
  * spawn rules / timers
  * scoring / combos
* **Run tests before every commit**: `npm test`
* Fix failing tests immediately.
* Keep changes small and reviewable.
* Performance hygiene:

  * avoid allocations in the hot loop
  * avoid per-frame React state updates for simulation
  * cap delta time to prevent “spiral of death” on slow frames

## Documentation Requirements

### README.md Must Include

* Game description (genre + core loop)
* Controls (keyboard/mouse)
* How to run locally:

  * `npm install`
  * `npm run dev`
* How to test and build:

  * `npm test`
  * `npm run build` / `npm run preview`

### docs/thegame_creation.md Rules

#### Plan Maintenance

* **Track Progress**

  * Use checkboxes:

    * `- [ ] Task`
    * `- [x] Task`
  * Update after every session.
* **Document Decisions**

  * Record significant technical decisions in “Notes & Decisions”:

    * Canvas vs DOM renderer rationale
    * fixed timestep choice
    * asset pipeline choices
    * collision approach and trade-offs
* **Update Dates**

  * Keep any progress tables current with actual start/completion dates.

### .github/copilot-instructions.md Maintenance

* **Keep Current**

  * Update when implementation diverges from the plan.
* **Add Learnings**

  * Note patterns/conventions discovered during development (e.g., entity update ordering, collision layers).
* **Technical Accuracy**

  * Ensure stack details, structure, and feature descriptions match the codebase.

## First Step (Repo Initialization)

1. Create a local folder: `C:\development\repos\thegame`
2. `cd C:\development\repos\thegame`
3. `git init`
4. Create a new repo at `https://github.com/philiv99/thegame`
5. Ensure the repo uses a **main** branch (NOT master)
6. **IMPORTANT:** create repo with a `README.md` and an appropriate `.gitignore`
7. Add remote + push:

   * `git remote add origin <repo-url>`
   * `git add .`
   * `git commit -m "chore: initial commit"`
   * `git branch -M main`
   * `git push -u origin main`
8. Begin execution using the session loop below

## “Execute the Plan” Session Loop (docs/thegame_creation.md)

For each stage/phase/step, follow this exact loop:

1. **Read plan**

   * Open `docs/thegame_creation.md` and identify the next `- [ ]` tasks.
2. **Implement**

   * Make changes only inside the repo.
3. **Test**

   * Run `npm test`
   * Run `npm run build` when changes affect bundling, assets, or production behavior.
4. **Commit**

   * Atomic commit with a clear message:

     * `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `test: ...`, `docs: ...`, `refactor: ...`, `chore: ...`
5. **Update plan**

   * Check off completed tasks and add brief notes on deviations/decisions.
6. **Repeat**

   * Continue until the phase is completed.

When completed:

1. Push the committed changes to the current feature branch:

   * `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
2. Create a pull request to merge the branch into main:

   * `gh pr create --base main --head <branch-name> --title "..." --body "..."`
3. Send communication stating a Pull Request has been created (PR merge will be completed by hand).

## Non-Negotiables

* No file operations outside the repo folder.
* No `$HOME$/.copilot/sessions`.
* `docs/thegame_creation.md` is the single source of truth for what to do next.
